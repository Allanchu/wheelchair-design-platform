# Orientation sensors
These sensors serve to provide orientation data, and they normally mix several different sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers.

## BNO055 Intelligent 9-axis absolute orientation sensor
![](1.png)

This 9-DOF (Degrees of freedom) sensor turns the sensor data from an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer into 3D space orientation.
These so called sensor fusion algorithms that blend accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope data into stable three-axis orientation output can be difficult to implement on low cost real time systems.

The BNO055 manages to get this right by taking a MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems) accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope and putting them on a single die with a high speed ARM Cortex-M0 based processor to process all the sensor data, abstract away sensor fusion and real time requirements, and output data you can use in quaternions, Euler angles or vectors.


### Technical details
This Sensor will require the use of the Adafruit Unified Sensor (Adafruit_Sensor), and Adafruit BNO055 libraries.

The data from this board can be accessed in several formats, namely:

* Absolute Orientation (Euler Vector, 100Hz) - Three axis orientation data based on a 360Â° sphere;
* Absolute Orientation (Quaternion, 100Hz) - Four point quaternion output for more accurate data manipulation;
* Angular Velocity Vector (100Hz) - Three axis of 'rotation speed' in rad/s;
* Acceleration Vector (100Hz) - Three axis of acceleration (gravity + linear motion) in m/s^2;
* Magnetic Field Strength Vector (20Hz) - Three axis of magnetic field sensing in micro Tesla (uT);
* Linear Acceleration Vector (100Hz) - Three axis of linear acceleration data (acceleration minus gravity) in m/s^2;
* Gravity Vector (100Hz) - Three axis of gravitational acceleration (minus any movement) in m/s^2;
* Temperature (1Hz) - Ambient temperature in degrees celsius;

### Pins
Now, lets see what each pin of this board is for:

![](2.png)

* **Vin** - 3.3-5.0V power supply input;
* **3vo** - 3.3V output from internal voltage regulator, may supply up to 500mA, if needed;
* **GND** - The common/GND pin;
* **SDA** - I2C data pin, can be used with 3V or 5V logic, and there's a 10K pullup on this pin;
* **SCL** -  I2C clock pin, can be used with 3V or 5V logic, and there's a 10K pullup on this pin;
* **RST** - 5V safe hardware reset pin. Can be set to low, then high to cause a reset on the sensor;
* **PS0 & PS1** - These pins can be used to change the mode of the device (it can also do HID-I2C (HID (Human interface device) over I2C) and UART (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter)), and also are provided in case Bosch provides a firmware update at some point for the ARM Cortex M0 MCU inside the sensor. They should normally be left unconnected;
* **INT** - 3V voltage level hardware interrupt output pin, can be configured to generate an interrupt signal upon certain events, like movement detected by the accelerometer, etc. (not currently supported in the Adafruit library, but the chip and HW (hardware) is capable of generating this signal);
* **ADR** - this pin can be set to high to change the default I2C address for the BNO055, if you need to connect two ICs on the same I2C bus. The default address is 0x28. If this pin is connected to 3V, the address will be 0x29.

# Proximity Sensors

## Infrared Proximity Sensors
IR sensors are proximity sensors that use  Infrared rays to  measure distance to objects. This is done by blasting the ray, catching the reflection and calculating the distance between the two objects! Can be used for detecting objects, obstacle detection, and other applications!

###  Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F Long Range
This IR proximity sensor made by Sharp is good for sensing objects up to 1.5m away and, in our case, comes with a Japanese Solderless Terminal(JST) connector. This connector has three wires:
* Red - to connect to $V_{cc}$;
* Black - to connect to Ground;
* Yellow - Analog Output.

#### Technical Details

* Supply voltage  between [4.5 - 5.5]V;
* Analog output 2.8V (15 cm), to 0.4V(150cm);
* Distance Measuring Range [20 - 150]cm
